>Bubble/Shell sort : Exchange two adjacent elements if they are out of order. Repeat until array is sorted.

>Selection sort : Find the smallest (or biggest) element in the array, and put it in the proper place. Swap it with the value in the first position. Repeat until array is sorted.

>Quick sort : Partition the array into two segments. In the first segment, all elements are less than or equal to the pivot value. In the second segment, all elements are greater than or equal to the pivot value. Finally, sort the two segments recursively.
